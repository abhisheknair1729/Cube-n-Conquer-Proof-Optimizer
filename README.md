# Proof Optimizer for Cube-and-Conquer SAT solvers

### Description

This tool stitches unsatisfiability proofs generated by Cube-and-Conquer SAT solvers into a single optimized proof, reducing proof checking time by several orders of magnitude.

### Prerequisites

1. Python>=3.6.8
2. Linux-based system

### Installation

Clone repository to any linux-based system

### Usage

    python3 proof_optimizer.py <CNF FILE> <DIRECTORY CONTAINING PROOFS> <OPTIMIZATION LEVEL>

OPTIMIZATION LEVEL : <0, 1, 2>  
0: No Optimization. All proofs in directory are concatenated together without attempting to reduce their size  
1: Intelligent Optimization. Proofs are concatenated and then a heuristic is applied to determine if redundant clauses should be removed  
2: Maximum Optimization. Proofs are concatenated and redundant clauses are removed  

#### Example
  
    python3 proof_optimizer.py example/cnf/random_ksat.dimacs example/proof/ 0
