# Proof Optimizer for Cube-and-Conquer SAT solvers

### Description

This tool stitches unsatisfiability proofs generated by Cube-and-Conquer SAT solvers into a single optimized proof, reducing proof checking time by several orders of magnitude.

### Prerequisites

1. Python>=3.6.8
2. Linux-based system (Tested on CentOS)

### Installation

Clone repository to any linux-based system

### Usage

    python3 proof_optimizer.py <CNF FILE> <DIRECTORY CONTAINING PROOFS> <OPTIMIZATION LEVEL>

CNF FILE: The file describing the SAT problem in [dimacs](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/moore/acl2/manuals/current/manual/index-seo.php/SATLINK____DIMACS) format  

DIRECTORY: The directory that contains the proof files generated by the cube-and-conquer solver  

OPTIMIZATION LEVEL : 0 or 1 or 2  
0: No Optimization  
1: Intelligent Optimization
2: Maximum Optimization  

#### Example
  
    python3 proof_optimizer.py example/cnf/random_ksat.dimacs example/proof/ 0
